<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>
<div class="blurb">
<p>Using this <a href="IMH.xml">XML</a> as your source, which is an entire journal with several articles, make an EPUB for it that separates the articles into individual HTML pages. You can probably reuse the XSLT you made for this same file for a <a href="xslt-hw3.html">previous assignment</a>. Feel free to use XSLT to make other needed files (table of contents and manifest) but please submit a complete and functioning EPUB.</p> 
<p>Please upload your EPUB file to Canvas.</p>
