<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>
<div class="blurb">
  <p>First, find an EPUB somewhere and see if you can read it on your computer somehow. We'll dissect our EPUBs together before making one of our own.</p>
  <p>Next, we'll work on creating an EPUB from this simple <a href="my_book.html">file</a>.</p>
  <p>To package EPUBs, which we might have time to do, you will need a tool like <a href="https://www.docdataflow.com/ecancrusher/">ecancrusher</a> to be installed on your computer.</p>
  <p>To finish, you can either work on the <a href="epub-hw.html">homework</a>, your individual final project, or both.</p>
