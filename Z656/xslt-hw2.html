<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>
<div class="blurb">
<p>Using this <a href="http://gd2.mlb.com/components/game/mlb/year_2011/month_04/day_04/gid_2011_04_04_minmlb_nyamlb_1/players.xml">XML</a> as your source, create an XSLT transformation that turns the information into an HTML web page. Be sure to include some descriptive info and data headings so the page makes sense.</p>
<p>Your XSLT should include the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Introductory general information about the game</li>
<li>Two tables that convey relevant box score data for each team</li>
<li>A variable that contains a concatenation of relevant game information, to be used more than once in your HTML</li>
<li>Sorting based on some metadata about individual players: batting average, last name, jersey number, etc.</li>
</ol>
<p>Make your HTML file link to the CSS stylesheet you developed for your GitHub Pages site and host the HTML and XSLT on GitHub in a subdirectory. Feel free to make adjustments to your GitHub Pages CSS as you see fit. Please sumbit a link to this subdirectory in Canvas.</p>
