<p>Using this <a href="xquery.zip">folder of XML</a> as your source, create an XQuery that returns a valid and well-formed XML with the following questions answered:</p>
<ol>
<li>What's the unique ID of each finding aid?</li>
<li>What's the title of each finding aid?</li>
<li>What's the number of years each finding aid covers (e.g., 1982-2000 = 18 years)?</li>
<li>What's the name of the person who encoded each finding aid?</li>
<li>How many times was each finding aid changed?</li>
<li>What's the physical extent of each finding aid?</li>
<li>In a single element per collection, could you list all of the access restrictions separated by a |?</li>
<li>In repeatable sub-elements, what are all of the indexing terms for each collection?</li>
<li>How many files are in each collection?</li>
<li>Could I see these returned from largest to smallest collection in terms of volume?</li>
</ol>

<p>Please submit a link to this XQuery in Canvas.</p>
