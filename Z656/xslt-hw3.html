<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>
<div class="blurb">
<p>Using this <a href="IMH.xml">XML</a> as your source, create an XSLT transformation that turns the information into separate HTML web pages for each journal article using result-document.</p>
<p>Your XSLT should include the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Treatment of the different text styles (bold, italics, etc.)</li>
<li>Some sort of styling for positional elements (this thing should be on the right side, etc.)</li>
<li>Metadata at the beginning of each article.</li>
</ol>
<p>Make your HTML files link to a CSS stylesheet developed specifically for these articles and host them on GitHub in a subdirectory containing all articles and your XSLT.</p>
<p>Your CSS should:</p>
<ol>
<li>Include an uploaded font</li>
<li>Make your articles look old-timey by mimicking the <a href="https://scholarworks.iu.edu/journals/index.php/imh/issue/view/684">original appearance of them</a> (see the PDFs).</li>
</ol>
<p>Please submit a link to this subdirectory in Canvas.</p>
