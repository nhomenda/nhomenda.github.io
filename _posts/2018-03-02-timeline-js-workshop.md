1. To start, copy this [Google Spreadsheet Template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pHBvXN7nmGkiG8uQSUB82eNlnL8xHu6kydzH_-eguHQ/template/preview?usp=drive_web) to your Google Drive and File -> Publish to the Web...

2. Next, copy the URL (the one in the browser bar, **not the one in the "Publish to the Web" window**) of your spreadsheet and preview it on the [TimelineJS Site](https://timeline.knightlab.com/#make-step-3).

3. Here's an [image](https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2015/04/AshevilleScene/lead_960.jpg?1430308869) for testing purposes but you can easily use images from Flickr or anywhere else.

4. Here are some [background colors](https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_names.asp) you can use to customize the look of your timeline slides, or you can use another image.

5. Here are some HTML examples that you can try:
  
    a. &lt;a href="www.website.com" title="title text"&gt;text to display&lt;/a&gt;
    
    b. &lt;p&gt;Paragraph text&lt;/p&gt;
    
    c. &lt;h1 style="color:red !important; font-size:46px !important;"&gt;Heading&lt;/h1&gt;
    
6. Here's my [example timeline](https://nhomenda.github.io/blog/2017/06/15/timeline-js-example) that I showed today.
    
    a. Here's the [Google Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14oeUonTxPoHDJQD5md5Ir3TtozcDs8wdurWWtd25SV8/edit#gid=00) that powers it.
    
7. Here's a [Box note](https://iu.app.box.com/notes/138331377986) for future reference about how to do the things we covered today.
