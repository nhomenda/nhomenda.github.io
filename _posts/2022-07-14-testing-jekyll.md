	<p>Here are activities we will do today to learn about digital scholarship.</p>
  <h2>Activity 1: History of IU Residence Halls</h2>
  <p>Today we'll each do some tiny research projects about notable IU Alumni.</p>
  <h3>Step 1</h3>
  <p>Pick an alumnus from this list:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Avery Brooks</li>
    <li>Joe Buck</li>
    <li>Suzanne Collins</li>
    <li>Laverne Cox</li>
    <li>Mark Cuban</li>
    <li>Ben Higgins</li>
    <li>Kevin Kline</li>
    <li>Victor Oladipo</li>
    <li>Elinor Ostrom</li>
    <li>Ryan Murphy</li>
    <li>Trista Sutter (n√©e Rehn)</li>
    <li>James Watson</li>
    <li>Mike Woodson</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Step 2</h3>
	<p>See which of these questions you can answer in 10 minutes of searching:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>How is this person best known?</li>
    <li>When and where were they born?</li>
    <li>When did they go to IU (your best guess)?</li>
    <li>Where did they go after IU?</li>
    <li>Where are they now?</li>
  </ul>
<h3>Step 3</h3>
<p>Can you find times (years are okay) and places (cities are okay) for the above?</p>

<h2>Activity 2: TimeMapper</h2>
<p>TimeMapper uses Google Sheets to publish interactive time maps, which position individual events on a map.</p>
	<p>To get started, let's look at my <a href="https://nhomenda.github.io/blog/2018/08/06/timemapper">example</a>.</p>
	<p><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ngHCjZJAp_yNeeIEpE3Y4L6xAwDORDy9EQNeCj7JXWc/edit#gid=0">Here's my spreadsheet data behind it</a>.</p>
	<p><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LlYBnfhvD3ZUXMGZ8e52UwYp-xn_NeWmaGBx7VBz5V8/edit#gid=0">Here's the spreadsheet template</a>.</p>
	<p>My example map uses a map I published to my account and embedded on this site. You can get a free account by logging in with your Twitter account. You can also publish anonymously, as long as your Google Sheet is published to the web.</p>
		<p><a href="http://timemapper.okfnlabs.org/anon/v4dxy1-herman-b-wells-history">Here's the same map as above, published anonymously</a>.</p>
	<p>If you're looking for images of your alum, you can try <a href="https://issuu.com/arbutusyearbook/docs">Arbutus Yearbooks</a> or the <a href="https://webapp1.dlib.indiana.edu/archivesphotos/index.jsp">IU Archives Photographs</a> websites.</p>
	<hr/>
<h2>Activity 3: Retrospective and Project Planning</h2>
<p>Now we will reflect on what we've done today and review the effort we spent building these miniature research projects.</p>
	<p>Consider these activities:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Selecting a topic</li>
		<li>Researching events and locations</li>
		<li>Finding images</li>
		<li>Adding your data to Google Spreadsheets</li>
		<li>Making design decisions</li>
		<li>Troubleshooting problems</li>
	</ul>
	<p>I'd like you to rank each of these activities in two ways:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Order of difficulty: easiest to most difficult</li>
		<li>Time spent: least time to most time</li>
	</ol>
