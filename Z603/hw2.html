<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>
<div class="blurb">
<p>Write CSS to style this <a href="https://nhomenda.github.io/Z656/titlepage.xml">XML code</a> to look as close as possible to the printed page shown below. Be sure to use a free custom font that you can download from <a href="https://www.fontsquirrel.com/">Font Squirrel</a> or link from somewhere else.<p>
<p>You can attach your CSS to an XML document by including a special processing instruction directly below the XML declaration:</p>
<code>&lt;?xml-stylesheet href="xml-style.css" type="text/css"?&gt;</code>
<p>Upload the source XML file, CSS stylesheet, and any necessary assets to your GitHub Pages site within its own subdirectory. Please submit a link to that subdirectory via Canvas.</p>
