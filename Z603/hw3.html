<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>
<div class="blurb">
<p>Using this <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/xml/plant_catalog.xml">simple XML</a> as your source, create an XSLT transformation that turns the information into an HTML web page. Be sure to include some descriptive info and data headings so the page makes sense.</p> 
<p>Using the XSLT, make your HTML file link to the CSS stylesheet you developed for your GitHub Pages site and host the HTML and XSLT on GitHub in a subdirectory. You shouldn't further edit what comes out of your XSLT transformation. Feel free to make adjustments to your GitHub Pages CSS as you see fit. Please submit a link to this subdirectory in Canvas.</p>
