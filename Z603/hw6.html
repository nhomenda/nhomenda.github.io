<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>
<div class="blurb">
<p>Using this <a href="xquery.zip">folder of XML</a> as your source, create an XQuery that returns a valid and well-formed XML with the following questions answered:</p>
<ol>
<li>What's the unique ID of each finding aid?</li>
<li>What's the title of each finding aid?</li>
<li>What's the number of years each finding aid covers (e.g., 1982-2000 = 18 years)?</li>
<li>What's the name of the person who encoded each finding aid?</li>
<li>How many times was each finding aid changed?</li>
<li>What's the physical extent of each finding aid?</li>
<li>In a single element per collection, could you list all of the access restrictions separated by a |?</li>
<li>What are the indexing terms used for each collection? Please express this in sub-elements with each term in its own element.</li>
<li>How many <b>files</b> are in each collection?</li>
<li>Could I see these returned from largest to smallest collection in terms of volume? There are a few ways you might try to calculate this based on available data, so please explain your rationale in a comment in your code.</li>
</ol>

<p>Please submit a link to this XQuery in Canvas and host your query on GitHub.</p>
