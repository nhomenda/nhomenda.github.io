<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>
<div class="blurb">
  <p>First, we'll talk about XQuery a little bit.</p>
  <p>Next, we'll do some XQuery to interrogate a TEI <a href="https://github.com/iulibdcs/Victorian-Women-Writers-Project/blob/master/vwwp_tei.zip">data set</a>.</p>
  <p>Our independent activity will involve answering the following questions about this data set:<p>
  <ol>
  <li>How many chapters are in each book?</li>
  <li>How many paragraphs are in each book?</li>
  <li>Which book has the most pages?</li>
  <li>Whatâ€™s the difference between amount of pages claimed in the metadata vs. the actual number of pages encoded?</li>
  </ol>
  <p>At the end of the class, we'll strategize how to do this week's <a href="/Z603/hw6.html">homework</a>.</p>
