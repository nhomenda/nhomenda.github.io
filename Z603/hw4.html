<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>
<div class="blurb">
<p>Write an XSLT to scrape data from this <a href="journal-list.xml">edited document</a>. I stripped out some non-well-formed content from <a href="https://www.cur.org/engage/undergraduate/journals/listing/">this webpage</a>.<p>
<p>Your XSLT should extract a useful dataset of undergraduate research journals from what's not very useful in list form.<p>
<p>Do not alter the source document! Use your XSLT skills to access the data you need.</p>
<p>Your XSLT should do the following things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Handle all content via templates, either transforming into a new element or not carrying that content forward.</li>
<li>Capture each journal's URL, name, and institution in table-like structure, e.g. each "record" is a row with individual cell children containing this data.</li>
<li>Order your results by institution ascending</li>
</ol>
<p>Please upload your XSLT and resulting XML file to a subdirectory in GitHub like in previous weeks.</p>
