<div class="blurb">
  <p>First, we'll learn XPath by revisiting this <a href="/Z603/simple.xml">simple</a> XML document.</p>
  <p>Next, we'll practice XPath in small groups using this <a href="http://purl.dlib.indiana.edu/iudl/vwwp/encodedtext/VAB7166">XML document</a>.</p>
  <p>We want to answer the following questions about this document:</p>
  <ol>
  <li>How many lines of poetry are there?</li>
  <li>How many verses of poetry are there?</li>
  <li>What’s the average number of lines per verse?</li>
  <li>Without looking at the table of contents, how can I get a list of all the titles of the poems?</li>
  <li>How many lines in this work contain the word “wine”?</li>
  <li>What’s the title of the 50th poem?</li>
  </ol>
  <p>After a break, we'll learn about XSLT and make our first transformation! We'll use <a href="/Z603/simple.xml">this one</a> again.</p>
  <p>At the end of the class, we'll strategize how to do this week's <a href="/Z603/hw3.html">homework</a>.</p>
