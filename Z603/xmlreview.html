  <p>Using your selected XML standard, take 15 minutes to prepare a 3 minute presentation to the class about it, describing the standard by answering these questions:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>What’s its homepage?</li>
    <li>Who created it and when?</li>
    <li>What’s its governing body now, or, who maintains it?</li>
    <li>When was it last updated?</li>
    <li>What is it used to primarily encode?</li>
    <li>How human-readable is it: do the element and attribute names make any sense?</li>
    <li>Who uses this standard?</li>
    <li>What’s the root element?</li>
    <li>What are the main elements you’d see just below the root element?</li>
    <li>Would you use this in a digital publishing system? For publishing what?</li>
  </ul>
  <p>In addition, please show a real-world example of one of these XML files and/or a project or system that uses them.</p>
